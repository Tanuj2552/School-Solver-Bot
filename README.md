# School-Solver-Bot
It is a simple web scraping bot, that displays a text message on your screen, when a new question is added in the school solver.

For this to work, you should have the following installed in your system.

1) Python3 & pip (https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows)

2) Google Chrome Driver, which can be installed from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/ 
    (Note: The version of the chrome driver is based on the version of your chrome browser. Check it before downloading it)
    
3) After downloading the driver, unzip it and edit the 'PATH' variable in the code (present in the 62nd line) based on your path of installation of the web driver.

4) you must also install selenium, turtle, tkinter which can be installed using
    1) pip install selenium
    2) pip install tk
    3) pip install turtle

After this, all you have to do is to run the code from any of your IDE's or text editors.. or terminal

This detects when there is a new question and shows you indication.

And you have to rerun this file after every new question indication.

NOTE: This code is still in basic development stage, I am trying to add more features to it.

Feel free to pull request and inform about any errors in the code :)
